<h2>Importing Snaps</h2>

<p>There is an error on page 66. Rather than it saying:</p>

<p class="code">from snaps import * </p>

<p>It should just say: </p> 

<p class="code">import snaps</p>

<p>To make snaps work you just have to have the snaps program in the same folder as your program.</p>

<h2>Using the keyboard with Snaps</h2>

<p>There have been some reports of the keyboard reading function in Snaps not working correctly when you run your Python program from within an IDE such as pyCharm or IDLE. If you find the keyboard to be unresponsive, try running the Python program directly in Python, rather than inside an IDE.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the links, the sample programs, or the book, you can get in touch with me via email on questions at begintocodewithpython.com. You can also tweet any questions to @begintocode or @robmiles
